# MoreCharges
MoreCharges is a simple mod that adds a few more utility charges. The Fire Charge has been alone for too long!

## New Charges

### Ender Charge

<br>An instant chorus fruit with slightly increased range, however you take damage as when using an ender pearl.

### Aqua Charge

### Resonating Charge

<br>A raid bell you don't have to place down! Range and glow time is reduced compared to the raid bell.

This is my first attempt at creating mods for Minecraft, so it may not be perfect!
